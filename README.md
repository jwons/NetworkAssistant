To simplify the job of the mobile response team.

# What does it do?

This program is intended to be used by Network Support as a simple information aggregator. 

The team has to keep track of multiple things throughout the day including but not limited to a schedule for surveying buildings, a schedule for closet maintenance, and the tickets on Request Tracker. This program will pull data from multiple these sources to present it all in one place for the members of the team.
