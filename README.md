# Network Assistant
To simplify the job of the mobile response team.

# What does it do?

This program is intended to be used by Network Support as a simple information aggregator. 

The team has to keep track of multiple things throughout the day including, but not limited to, a schedule for surveying buildings, a schedule for closet maintenance, and the tickets on Request Tracker. This program will present data for members of the team and provide a way to keep track of who is doing what. 

# What does it do *now*?

At the moment it reads schedules given to it through .csv files to show the employee buildings and closets. It gives employees the opportunity log they had finished a survey. It *had* RT support, although at the moment it was not worth the time it took to login.

# Future Work
Add RT features and functionality to make it worth the time to login.
