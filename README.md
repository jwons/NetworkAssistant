# Network Assistant
To simplify the job of the mobile response team.

# What does it do?

This program is intended to be used by Network Support as a simple information aggregator. 

The team has to keep track of multiple things throughout the day including, but not limited to, a schedule for surveying buildings, a schedule for closet maintenance, and the tickets on Request Tracker. This program will pull data from multiple these sources to present it all in one place for the members of the team. 

# What does it do *now*?

At the moment it reads schedules given to it through .csv files to show the employee buildings and closets. It *had* RT support, although at the moment it was not worth the time it took to login.

# Future Work

The current plan is to use the program to keep track of who is doing surveys and closet checks as well. This way we can switch over from the printed out hard copy. Further future work is add RT features and functionality. 

# What is the timeline for this project?

I work on it when I have time. Which is sporadic. 

# Libraries used

appJar was used to create the user interface for this project: http://appjar.info/

Python rtkit for Request Tracker was previously used, but not at the moment.
